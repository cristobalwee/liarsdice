This is a multiplayer game, made to simulate a cup and five dice - this is not a game to be played by a single person; you must be in the same room with the people with whom you are playing, each of which must have the app on their phone. Although it would be possible to create an online version of the game (which this app does not support), the essence of Liar's Dice is to be able to see your opponents, and base your moves off their reactions.

Liar’s Dice is a complex game of probability and deceit played with 2 or more people, each with 5 six sided dice and a small cup.

RULES: all players begin by shaking their phones to roll the dice. The first bidder can be chosen at random or simply by rolling one die for the highest value.

BIDDING: unless called by the first bidder, 1’s are wild (it’s therefore common for the first player to bid on values higher than 1). A player’s bid is for all the dice on the table, and each bid must be higher than the previous in either face value or quantity. Example: 

	Player 1: Four 5’s
	
	Player 2: Six 5’s
	
	Player 3: Three 6’s
	
It’s also customary to allow for players to bid on 1’s, but only at half the quantity of the previous bid (rounding up on odd numbers). Example:

	Player 1: Three 4’s
	
	Player 2: Five 4’s
	
	Player 3: Three 1’s
	
CHALLENGING: if a player believes the previous bid is statistically unlikely, he or she may choose to challenge it. A player may only challenge on his or her turn and the challenge must be to the current bid as given by the previous player. When a player challenges a bid, everyone must lift their cups and show their dice. If the amount of the face value told by the bidder is less than that of the table, the challenged player loses; otherwise, the challenger loses. Whoever loses must take one die from their cup, after which everyone will roll their dice again, resetting the game. The player that remains with at least one die after all others have lost theirs wins the game.

VARIANTS: Liar's Dice is notorious for having a large amount of variants in gameplay, some of which are outlined below

  ALTERNATE BIDDING - while it is common for bidding to take on the above format (i.e. bidding on a higher quantity of the same face, or any quantity of a higher face), other variants allow for bidding on a higher quantity of any face, or the same quantity of a higher face; alternatively, for more restrictive gameplay, bidding can be in the format of bidding on a higher quantity of the same face or the same quantity of a higher face.
  
  SICILIAN BID - The first player must abide by the “Sicilian bid”; that is, aces aren’t wild on the first bid of each round of play, but become wild on all bids after.
  
  PASSING - Players are allowed to pass on their turn if they have no two dice of the same face value, which can be challenged by the subsequent player. 
  
  SPOT ON - As opposed to challenging, a player may also choose to claim that the current bid is exactly correct; if it is, then he/she may gain a lost die; otherwise, he/she must lose a die from their cup.
